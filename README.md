Janebot represents a cutting-edge interactive chatbot system meticulously designed to deliver a profoundly engaging, human-like conversational experience. The platform integrates a robust Java-based backend server with a responsive and intuitive frontend interface, complemented by a finely tuned text-to-speech (TTS) system that mimics natural human speech with remarkable fidelity.

## Features

- **AI-Driven Conversational Intelligence:** Employs state-of-the-art AI models to generate contextually relevant and highly nuanced responses, ensuring seamless and engaging interactions.
- **Sophisticated Speech Rendering:** The TTS engine is carefully optimized with configurable parameters such as speech rate, pitch, and tone to emulate natural, dynamic speech patterns.
- **Java-Powered Backend:** Leverages Java's `HttpServer` framework to efficiently manage real-time chatbot interactions and external API integrations.
- **User-Centric Frontend Interface:** Designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the interface provides a clean and interactive platform for user engagement.
- **Cultural Personalization:** Jane, the chatbot persona, embodies a distinctive and relatable character inspired by Kerala's cultural heritage, enriching user interactions with warmth and authenticity.
- **Persistent Session Management:** Utilizes unique session identifiers to maintain conversational continuity and deliver a coherent user experience.

## Fine-Tuned Conversational Capabilities

Janebot's conversational and speech features have been meticulously refined to achieve a highly human-like interaction experience:

- **Dynamic Speech Modulation:** The TTS system intelligently adjusts speech rate and tone based on contextual factors, ensuring responses are both clear and naturally flowing.
- **Enhanced Prompt Engineering:** Sophisticated AI prompting techniques optimize conversational coherence, emotional relatability, and humor, giving Jane a vibrant and engaging personality.

```

## Backend Implementation

The backend server, implemented in Java, operates on port `8000`. It processes incoming chat requests, seamlessly integrates external APIs for AI responses and TTS functionalities, and delivers Jane's tailored responses with precision.

### Core Java Components

- **ChatbotServer:** Serves as the central entry point for the server application.
- **ChatHandler:** Manages HTTP requests and facilitates integration with external chatbot and TTS APIs.

### Setup Instructions for Backend

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gracemann365/Janebot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `Janebot-server` directory.
3. Compile the Java source code:
   ```bash
   javac ChatbotServer.java
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   java ChatbotServer
   ```
5. Access the server at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Frontend Functionality

The frontend interface provides an engaging medium for users to interact with Jane. Key functionalities include:

- **Simulated Typewriter Effect:** Dynamically renders Jane's responses for an enhanced visual experience.
- **Integrated TTS Playback:** Plays audio responses generated by the TTS engine, delivering a fully immersive conversational experience.

### Usage Instructions

1. Open `app.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter your messages into the chat input field and enjoy interacting with Jane.

## API Specifications

### Chat API

- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:8000/chat`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Format (JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "sessionId": "user123",
    "userInput": "Hello, Jane!"
  }
  ```
- **Response Format (Text):**
  ```
  "Hi there! How can I help you today?"
  ```

### Text-to-Speech API

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.v7.unrealspeech.com/stream`
- **Method:** POST
- **Request Headers:**
  - `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  ```json
  {
    "Text": "Hello!",
    "VoiceId": "Liv",
    "Bitrate": "192k",
    "Speed": "0.19",
    "Pitch": "1.08",
    "Codec": "libmp3lame"
  }
  ```
- **Response:** Audio stream of the TTS output.

## Customization

The chatbot's personality, API credentials, and server parameters can be tailored by modifying constants in `ChatbotServer.java`:

- `API_URL`: Specifies the chatbot API endpoint.
- `API_KEY`: Provides access credentials for external API services.
- `MODEL`: Identifies the AI model utilized for conversational processing.

## Known Limitations

- Ensure API credentials and URLs are correctly configured prior to server execution.
- The TTS API requires an active internet connection and valid authentication.
- Current implementation uses a static session ID (`user123`) for testing; dynamic session handling is recommended for production environments.

## Prospective Enhancements

- Incorporate user authentication for a more personalized chatbot experience.
- Implement database support for session history persistence.
- Upgrade the user interface with advanced animations and interactive elements.
- Deploy the backend on a cloud platform for public access and scalability.
